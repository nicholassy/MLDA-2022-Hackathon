 ## Motivation:
 
 The SMART Nation is an initiative created by the Singapore Government to harness infocomm technology, networks and big data to create tech-enabled solutions. 
 
 Add in the fact that in Singapore, 21 people die from cardiovascular disease everyday and it accounted for 32% of all deaths in Singapore during the year 2021.
 
 ## Problem Definition:
 
 Therefore, our Team has decided to focus on the healthcare sector to help elevate the medical literacy of the citizens of Singapore. Since individuals are prone to diseases of any spectrum; Hereditary or Non-Heriditary.
 
 The disease that our team will be tackling on:
 - Heart Disease
 - Cardiovascular Disease
 
 Hence, this project aims to predict the possible diseases that one may based on:
 - Previous survey about heart disease
 - Past records of patients data
 
  ## AI model we used:
 
 RandomForestClassifier
 
 ## Dataset we used:
 
 Heart Disease Dataset:

 Cardiovascular Dataset:
